## On this Portfolio:

This is a text-based portfolio of projects and hypotheses relevant to my work. 

Projects are technical endeavors to either build a functional tool for a specific purpose or to convey an argument. 

Hypotheses are possible arguments, which I intend to develop, though I feel the need for some mentor or authority to test their rigor and critique them.


***All my work strives to be an application of [[Unflattening]] for critique and study of [[mimesis]] through [[technologies of alternative scholarship]].***


## On Navigating this Portfolio:

Pages can be navigated to by clicking on the hyperlinks embedded in certain words, which appear in a different color than the base text. This is intended to be a use and demonstration of one of my hypotheses: exploring [[3D Writing for Alternative Scholarship with Hyperlinks]].

There are 5 types of pages on this website. At the bottom of each page, the user can find that page's type, along with backlinks to help with navigation.

The 5 types are:
- hubs
- concepts
- references
- hypotheses
- projects

A hub page is a centralized node from which the user can explore several branching paths.

A concept page details an argument or idea put forth by a thinker whose work influences mine.

A reference page provides sources and explanations of thinkers whose work inspires some aspect of mine. These provide textual evidence in all of my projects. Some reference pages are subdivided into categories of concepts. By tracking the ways in which the hyperlinks relate certain pages to each other, the user can follow how one work inspired another.

A hypothesis page is less technical and detailed than a project page. These present arguments I propose regarding philosophy, language, performance, and learning. These are arguments I seek to test as I enter academia, with the help of mentors and institutions willing and capable to guide and assess my work. Hypotheses do not rely on technical writing so much as [[Hyperlink Poetry for Argumentation]].

A project page includes a technical project. There are 3 kinds of technical projects I intend to work on throughout my career as an academic: learning tools, sound sculptures, and performance art. Each project page is categorized into:
- a Synopsis page 
	- providing a project description
- a Method & Construction page 
	- detailing how the project is made or performed, with references
- a Stakes page 
	- indicating how the project serves as critique
- a page for Steps Taken 
	- indicating what progress I have made so far
- a page for Next Steps
	- indicating what work has not been done
- a page for What's Missing
	- indicating where I need support or see blindspots in the project
- a Related Projects page
	- which serves to show relation between works
- a References page
	- which provides the textual evidence that inspired the project




## On the Format of this Portfolio:

I personally find the Small Web -- use of the [Gemini Protocol](https://yesterweb.org/community/gemini/) , Dr. Andreas Zwinkau's idea of [The Spartan Web](https://beza1e1.tuxen.de/spartan_web.html), the [esolang](https://catseye.tc) community, etc. -- to be very endearing. When using the Internet, I often find myself distracted from my studies by content and advertisements. On the Small Web, where everything is plain text -- no images, no bots, no ads -- I find myself engaging with thought-provoking texts, communities, and personalities on the Internet. 

When brainstorming ways to put this portfolio together, this stood out as the most fitting way to do it -- especially since it allows me to use [[3D Writing for Alternative Scholarship with Hyperlinks]]. It's not shiny, or colorful -- but I hope it may retain the thought and technicality of what I'm trying to represent here.


## TL;DR

*If you've read everything above this section, I greatly appreciate that. I'm aware I might be shooting myself in the foot given the format I've chosen. Still, I hope this homepage demonstrates some aspects about the way I think -- the way memory and relation bear heavy on my mind and guide my work --, the way I write -- with attention to the way the medium performs for the writer and the reader --, and the way I work -- prioritizing thoroughness, transparency, and self-critique at the cost of concision.*

To begin, you may click on this link to the [[Projects Page]] for my technical work, or this link to the [[Hypotheses Page]] for my humanities-centric arguments. The most worthwhile pages in the order I recommend reading are: 
- [[3D Writing for Alternative Scholarship with Hyperlinks]] (Hypothesis)
- [[Gestural Measures in Vernacular and NLP]] (Project)
- [[Zithers]] (Hypothesis)
- [[On the Map Room: Cartography as Speculative Figure Drawing for Anarchival Practice]] (Project)
- [[Modeling Transverse Wave Interference Patterns in 2D and 3D with VR for Learning Wave Fundamentals and Integration in Physical Modeling of Acoustic Membranes]] (Project)
- [[Vocal Harmony Algorithms with Adapting Markov Chains and Shortest Paths]] (Project)

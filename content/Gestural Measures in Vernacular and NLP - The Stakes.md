The relevance of this project seeks to promulgate tools for Natural Language Processing in academic work that consider the vernaculars and dialects of thinkers whose language doesn't fit with Standard Written English conventions.

This idea has existed in academic work for centuries.

Dante Alighieri wrote on the distinction between academically recognized standard language and the people's language -- vernacular --, calling vernacular more noble than eloquent language.

In *The Portrait of the Artist* as a Young Man, James Joyce wrote on his language use feeling inferior to that of the Academy because of his vernacular's grammar and pronunciation. In Chapter 5, he wrote: "The language in which we are speaking is his before it is mine. How different are the words home, Christ, ale, master, on his lips and on mine! I cannot speak or write these words without unrest of spirit. His language, so familiar and so foreign, will always be for me an acquired speech. I have not made or accepted its words. My voice holds them at bay. My soul frets in the shadow of his language."

My study of these two sources' writing on vernacular in education made me privy to this issue, but it was a combination of David Foster Wallace's critique and my own experience with teaching English Language Arts to 9th Graders in the Bronx last summer that made apparent for me how much the lack of consideration for the nuances of vernacular in language education for younger students is serious issue.

 In his essay "Authority and American Usage", David Foster Wallace provided a nuanced critique of both descriptivism and prescriptivism. His argument against the prevalence of Standard Written English and prescriptivism in the schoolyard was particularly influential in my own teaching experience, and revitalized my interest in this project.

I hope to one day see this project to grow into a technical expansion of Jamilla Lyiscott's work toward legitimizing vernaculars and dialects of English as integral parts of academic writing.

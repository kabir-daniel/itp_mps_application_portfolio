*[Unflattening](https://spinweaveandcut.com/unflattening/)* was Dr. Nick Sousanis's doctoral thesis on education at Teachers' College. It was written as a comic, as a practice in alternative scholarship. 

The title is a reference to Edwin A. Abbottâ€™s *Flatland*, which Sousanis used in his critique of the linearity or "flatness" of modern educational institutions' metaphysics of learning. 

The comic book medium allowed Sousanis to "unflatten" the linearity of time and concepts that is normally presumed in traditional essay writing, as the reader's attention is often directed up and down the page, revisiting different elements of text and image as they inform each other, often sending the reader digging backward or forward across several pages to stitch together lines of thought set in motion by the author.

The result of Sousanis's demonstration of alternative scholarship is a rhizomatic book, which requires active learning as the process of reading the book, and in that process, fundamental aspects of the phenomenon of learning rise to presence for the reader to observe as the text provides critique on the aspects and phenomena at hand in learning. 


The process of reading *Unflattening* involves the reader in a performance of reading that demands for time and memory to cease being linear, giving the reader to experience "unflattening" in their imagination of experience, and providing a chance to engage with aspects of learning that are otherwise impossible to represent, resulting in a unique capacity for critique.


Dr. Sousanis's work has become foundational in my own, as it has guided the necessity for interdisciplinary measures and creative media for alternative scholarship in my work. 

He has shown genuine interest in how I plan to build upon and further develop his ideas in my own research, forming a meaningful academic connection. I am extremely grateful to have his work and mentorship to guide me in my academic journey. 


His work has directly influenced two hypotheses detailed in this website: [[3D Writing for Alternative Scholarship with Hyperlinks]] and [[Zithers]] -- the latter of which is a concept that comes from Dr. Sousanis's teaching practices.

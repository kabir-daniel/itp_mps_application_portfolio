A lack of representation for particular issues of difference in language have resulted in [issues in academia and popular literacy](obsidian://open?vault=ITPportfolio&file=Gestural%20Measures%20in%20Vernacular%20and%20NLP%20-%20References). 

I stumbled into one particular issue concerning data science and vernacular in my studies of Irish literature: the nuances of dialects and vernaculars of English are not considered by the current popular tools for Natural Language Processing (NLP) of English texts. As a result, the gestural measures of those texts are misrepresented when deriving analytics using NLP tools.

This project approaches the representation of the unique gestural qualities of a language's vernaculars using the [ToBI System](obsidian://open?vault=ITPportfolio&file=Gestural%20Measures%20in%20Vernacular%20and%20NLP%20-%20Method%20%26%20Construction).

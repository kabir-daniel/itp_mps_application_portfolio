Welcome! You can navigate this portfolio using the explorer on the left, the node map on the right, or by clicking directly on embedded hyperlinks.


I've included in this portfolio both [[Projects]] and [[Hypotheses]]. 

[[Projects]] are mostly technical -- some are just creative computing projects, and others use technical disciplines creatively alongside theoretical inquiry in an attempt at study or critique. 

[[Projects]] are categorized into performance pieces, sound sculptures, and creative computing tools.

[[Hypotheses]] are ideas I'm currently working out that might indicate the trajectory of what academic research I intend to follow throughout my career. These often go hand in hand with my technical projects.


[[Projects]] labeled defunct are no longer being worked on. Many of these informed different works, and the throughlines between different projects can be seen through the nodemap. 

This website is a work in progress, and some unfinished pages are labeled as incomplete.

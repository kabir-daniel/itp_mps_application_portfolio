### On the Map Room: Cartography as Speculative Figure Drawing for Anarchival Practice 

##### *Sound Sculpture*

***

Historically, map rooms served as a locus for information and power. Today, maps still inform and govern our ordinary lives. Maps guide map users in traversing or interpreting a space. 

  

Whether it's a literal map -- like in urban planning or legislative districts -- or an abstract map -- memory, or an archive, or the space of literature, or the space of law --, the map delimits for those who rely on it the possibility of how they could imagine or encounter the space. 

  

My argument for this relies on Nick Sousanis's Zithers -- skeletal lines he uses in designing a comic book page, governing the order in which the reader encounters the argument and determining how the reader's attention will be allocated -- and Ramona Naddaff's reading of Plato's *Republic* -- which delves deep into the nuances of how foundational myths control the possibility of what a state can become.

  

  

The sculpture itself for "On the Map Room" is a map room full of different maps represented in different ways. Some can be interacted with, giving the audience a sense of agency in encountering the map; others are fixed for them beforehand. Each unique map is accompanied by a written piece, serving as a critical lens into ways of imagining space, relation, and representation. Relevant topics will span from non-euclidean spaces, to maps of the cold war, and further.

  

Inspired by Heidegger's "Triadic Conversation" -- the character of the guide, in particular --, the space of the map room is itself a space to be traversed and interpreted, but there is no map for how to navigate the map room. Each audience member must make their own way for themselves.

  

"Speculative Figure Drawing" incorporates arguments of speculative thinking with Barthes's writing on fragments, figures, and discursis. This creates a foundation for criticism concerning presence/absence in (an)archival theory as a matter of traversal (space, time, relation).

### Confrontation: The Tree of Law 

##### *Sound Sculpture*

***

"The Tree of Law" is a sculpture modeled after the scale that is the symbol for Columbia's Education Graduate Program, "Teachers College". This is the institution which gave us both Nick Sousanis's *Unflattening* and Lucy Calkin's infamous balanced literacy curriculum. 

  

The installation lives in an enclosure that looks like a hanging bird cage. The cage is bifurcated by

The "Tree" 

  

The "T" figure in the Teachers College symbol serves as the trunk for "The Tree of Law", which represents a scale -- a universal symbol for law and justice. However, instead of balance pots hanging by wire from the branches of the "T", long, heavy gauge copper induction coils extend down and forward. 

  

"Confrontation is facing together. We recall that a face is a mask. A mask makes present by facing a face outward, concealing a face within. What a mask makes present is the character the body masked embodies in its performance. We cannot come to know the being at hand by the sight we're faced with; what we see is an illusion that lets us believe what character in front of us exists, seen through our eyes. Whether we come to know the being not in the light of reason but in the shadows of cognition's illuminations is not at hand -- we are, the technology of time. We are transient -- that aspect of the sound object that makes it characteristic of itself, in sound an essence. We forget our own existence -- that's how it stands out: by its passing on to the next tone or silence. We are stereoscopic, that's what lets us bind at all -- relation, exigence in context. Language is difference in motion, forgetting happening by memory's recognitions and releasement. We move about unmoving anchors in natural waters, plastic sound in stereo."

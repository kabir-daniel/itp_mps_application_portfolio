title: "On the Map Room: Cartography as Speculative Figure Drawing for Anarchival Practice"
---
*Topics: Anarchival Practice, Rhetorical Cartography, Figures and Discourse*
***
Historically, map rooms served as a locus for information and power. Today, maps still inform and govern our ordinary lives. Maps guide map users in traversing or interpreting a space. 


Whether it's a literal map -- like in urban planning or legislative districts -- or an abstract map -- memory, or an archive, or the space of literature, or the space of law --, the map delimits for those who rely on it the possibility of how they could imagine or encounter the space. 
  

My argument for this relies on Nick Sousanis's Zithers -- skeletal lines he uses in designing a comic book page, governing the order in which the reader encounters the argument and determining how the reader's attention will be allocated -- and Ramona Naddaff's reading of Plato's *Republic* -- which delves deep into the nuances of how foundational myths control the possibility of what a state can become.  



The sculpture itself for "On the Map Room" is a map room full of different maps represented in different ways. Some can be interacted with, giving the audience a sense of agency in encountering the map; others are fixed for them beforehand. Each unique map is accompanied by a written piece, serving as a critical lens into ways of imagining space, relation, and representation. Relevant topics will span from non-euclidean spaces, to maps of the cold war, and further.


Inspired by Heidegger's "Triadic Conversation" -- the character of the guide, in particular --, the space of the map room is itself a space to be traversed and interpreted, but there is no map for how to navigate the map room. Each audience member must make their own way for themselves.



"Speculative Figure Drawing" incorporates arguments of speculative thinking with Barthes's writing on fragments, figures, and discursis. This creates a foundation for criticism concerning presence/absence in (an)archival theory as a matter of traversal (space, time, relation).

Overview:

I began this project with guidance from Berkeley's Data Lab in Professor Catherine Flynn's class on AI and Irish Literature.

Combining methods in linguistics and data science with voice spectrum analysis, this project purports to visually represent the gestural quality of language in written text using the ToBI System. 

By combining standard Natural Language Processing tools (like the CMU Pronunciation Dictionary) with a program which used STFTs to analyze rhythmic and tonal inflections in speech, I created a program that could analyze written text and output a ToBI annotation visually representing the sonic gesture of what the text was saying. 

Initially, this project was an inquiry into whether or not the gestures of language could be analytically represented through the lens of the sound object. However, upon implementation of the program, I found a different problem: the CMU Pronunciation Dictionary does not accurately represent the sonic qualities of particular vernaculars of English (such as vernaculars or dialects of English spoken in Ireland). 

Finding writings from David Foster Wallace, James Joyce, and Dante Alighieri which critiqued representation (or lack thereof) in Academia for vernaculars of a language inspired me to further research this question of representing the sound object in language and its bearing on gestures in speech and written text. 

The future of this project involves using machine learning to analyze particular dialects and automatically generate pronunciation dictionaries for that demographic's usage of the language at hand, then visually representing the melodic and rhythmic gestures that arise in reading a text in that dialect to draw our attention to what differences may arise.

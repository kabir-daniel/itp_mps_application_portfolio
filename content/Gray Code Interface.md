I find the construction of tools and theories guided by what use can be derived from the work's production limits the possibility of what the work can become. As such, I've grown fond of what I call Alternative Computer Science -- uses of Computer Science that are more fun and creative than they are useful. Examples of AltCS include the intentionally inefficient systems of the esolang community, the gemini protocol, and grey code. 

Grey code in particular is pretty awful for efficient computing -- but it makes a great interface for a musical instrument. With just 4 buttons, 4 keystrokes can do the work of 15, and the way grey code enumerates is far more intuitive for the hand to learn with push buttons with 4 fingers than for binary. Adding a 5th button for the thumb to work control could make for a fascinating number of microtonal synthesizers with their own compositional biases (heuristics, if you will) deriving from the ergonomics of the hand and how the player approaches learning grey code by way of the hand. 

I would also like to incorporate this idea into a mechatronic bridge system to alter tuning while playing the piccolo bass, in my ongoing quest to acquire a more affordable hyperbass.

- [[Vocal Harmony Algorithms with Adapting Markov Chains and Shortest Paths]]
	- About a year prior to working on [[Gestural Measures in Vernacular and NLP]], I spent a lot of time playing around with creating vocal harmonizers and harmony algorithms. Creating algorithms which traversed the spectrum of harmony in music by heuristics opened my eyes to the possibility of what can be done with machines that can analyze sound, chart patterns, and learn. Without that work, I wouldn't have known how to proceed with [[Gestural Measures in Vernacular and NLP]].

- [[Generative Dialectics from Syntactic Structures]]
	- In my work with digital humanities, [[Gestural Measures in Vernacular and NLP]] was the successor to the project I had completed in Professor Okiji's class the semester prior -- [[Generative Dialectics from Syntactic Structures]] --, wherein I created a music machine that served as my first foray into making semiotic machines to represent and critique language use practices.

- [[Sound Sculpture]] for [[On the Map Room: Cartography as Speculative Figure Drawing for Anarchival Practice]]
	- The final form of [[Gestural Measures in Vernacular and NLP]] will be an integrated component in the [[Sound Sculpture]] I propose titled [[On the Map Room: Cartography as Speculative Figure Drawing for Anarchival Practice]].

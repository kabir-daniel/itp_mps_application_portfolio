It is important to note that the tools we use for Natural Language Processing today -- such as the CMU Pronunciation Dictionary -- are blind to the gestural influence of vernaculars and dialects over meaning and usage in language. 

In the long term, I have great interest in developing NLP tools to tokenize and represent gestural aspects of different vernaculars and dialects in English and, hopefully, in other languages as well. However, I will need a lot of guidance and support to develop the relevant skills and projects to create such toolkits. 

I began this work in an AIrish class with Professor Flynn and the Data Lab at Berkeley, looking at the efficacy of NLP tools being used in digital humanities to analyze Irish poetry and Irish historical texts, much of which is written in English but follows different gestural rules than the Queen's English or American Usage. 

The project involved using the CMU Pronunciation Dictionary to tokenize a play by W.B. Yeats and derive a ToBI representation of its gestures, then contrasting that with a ToBI datamap derived from actual recitation to discover that the digital tools were insufficient for accurately deriving analytics solely from visual text (which is the standard case when dealing with Irish historical texts, given their contentious history with censorship, oral tradition, dialects, and record-keeping). 

I believe this project extends to the representation of histories, identities, and information from underrepresented communities in America and abroad. Criticism of vernacular discrimination in Academia goes as far back as [Dante Alighieri](https://www.danteonline.it/english/opere.asp?idope=3&idlang=UK). In part due to modern internet content and social media, vernaculars in America are abounding, alongside geographically-anchored literacy challenges. In the development of more advanced language processing tools -- especially as the American populous becomes increasingly dependent on web-based generative language tools --, neglecting to account for these different people's vernaculars could be a detrimental oversight for entire demographics of Americans. 

I have Professor Flynn to thank for showing me that James Joyce was critiquing this subtle difference of how different vernaculars of English faced silent discrimination in Academia, and for guiding and supporting me as I tried to work on a project I didn't have the skills for.
